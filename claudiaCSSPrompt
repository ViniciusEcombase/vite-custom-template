Visual Style Guide:
Overall Aesthetic: Modern dark theme with a professional, clean interface that emphasizes usability and subtle elegance.
Color Philosophy: Dark-first design using a sophisticated grayscale palette (--color-gray-900 to --color-gray-600) as the foundation, with a vibrant orange primary color (--color-primary: #ff7a00) as the key accent that brings warmth and energy to the interface.
Typography: Clean, system font hierarchy using -apple-system/BlinkMacSystemFont for UI elements and Georgia serif for headings, creating a nice contrast between functional and elegant.
Spacing & Layout: Consistent 8px-based spacing system (--space-*) with generous padding and margins that create breathing room. Grid-based layouts that adapt responsively.
Interactive Elements:

Subtle hover states with gentle transforms (translateY(-1px))
Soft shadows that elevate on interaction
Smooth transitions (200ms) for all state changes
Focus states using the primary orange color
Form inputs with prominent focus states and primary-colored labels

Visual Hierarchy:

Primary orange for key actions and focus states
Light orange (--color-primary-light) for labels and secondary accents
White/off-white text for primary content
Muted grays for secondary text and placeholders
Card-based content areas with subtle shadows and rounded corners

Key Design Principles:

Accessibility-first with proper contrast and touch targets
Consistent border radius (--radius-base, --radius-lg)
Layered depth using shadows and background color variations
Smooth, non-jarring animations that enhance UX
Mobile-responsive with graceful degradation
